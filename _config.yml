# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm a developer based in Indonesia with around 3 years experience, 
  and sometimes obsessed with the project I'm working on, 
  I like to learn new things and try something different.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://zxce3.net" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
